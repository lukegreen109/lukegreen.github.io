I am a math masters student at Brigham Young University set to graduate April 2026. My math research background began in spectral graph theory and is now in active learning. I have sought to strike a balance between theoretical and computational skills, and I don't value one over the other.

Research Interests
======
My interests are centered around the Mathematics of Machine Learning. I appreciate rigorous mathematical treatment of machine learning methods, and I am especially interested in foundational understanding of deep learning and neural networks.

- Bayesian Inference/Statistics
- Sampling Methods
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Randomized Methods
- Active Learning
- Graph Based Methods
- Vision/Image Classification

I would like to get more involved with applications to energy and neuroscience.
